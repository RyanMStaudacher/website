            <p>What I currently do: I am a Quality Assurance Tester for Deep Silver Volition!</p>

            <p>
                What I would like to do: My goal is to become a Gameplay Programmer.
                I enjoy scripting game mechanics and features and tweaking and polishing them until they shine.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have a BA in Game Design with a concentration in Game Development.
                I have experience with multiple game engines and software, including Unity,
                Unreal Engine 4, Git, Github, Bitbucket, Sourcetree, Visual Studio, Blender,
                Trello, Jira, etc. I am proficient in C# with a basic knowledge of some other
                languages such as C++, Java, HTML, and CSS. I have worked on various projects
                with teams varying in size from 2 to 40+ and I have experience with both the
                agile and waterfall development processes. I was a Gameplay Programmer and
                level designer for Aiku, Columbia's capstone project for 2018, and a Gameplay
                Programmer for Quickdraw, a local 4-player co-op Western arena battle game.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I'm not making games I enjoy doing various things such as going to
                the gym, playing volleyball, and hanging out with my friends. I love traveling
                and there are plenty of places that I would like to go visit: Austria,
                Scotland, Japan, Europe, etc. I am also an avid gamer and you can often find
                me relaxing at my computer, playing my favorite games.
