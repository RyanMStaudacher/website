        <p>
            Quickdraw is a game that I helped to create for my Game Development Processing class. I am so pleased with the outcome of this project.
            This game is really fun to play, especially with your friends. The idea is that you are trying to shoot the 3 other people you are
            playing against, however you can only shoot when it is "High Noon". Each time it becomes high noon, all players stop moving, raise
            their guns, and attempt to shoot the other players.
            <br />
            <br />
            I helped with the programming of this game, particularly the movement of the players. This game is meant to be played with xbox 360
            controllers. Initially, I wanted all of the movement to be controlled using only the left thumbstick. For example, pushing up or down
            would move the player forward and back, while pushing left or right would turn the player left and right. However, we felt that this
            control scheme did not feel natural and ended up changing it to where the left thumbstick is used for forward/backward movement and left/right
            strafing, while the right thumbstick is used to look around. This control scheme feels much more natural for our FPS and player are less confused by it.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am currently trying to get a download link for Quickdraw, but I do not have it yet. While we wait for that, why not check out some of the other games I have worked on?
