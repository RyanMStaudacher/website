        <p>
            Float is a game that my buddy <a href="https://www.ryandavidcarpenter.com/" style="text-decoration:underline;color:inherit;">Ryan Carpenter</a> and I made for the 
            <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mix-and-game-jam" style="text-decoration:underline;color:inherit;">2019 Mix and Game Jam</a>. The idea behind it was to take the gravity hammer
            from Halo and make it 2d. Ryan handled the level design, UI, art, etc. and I did all of the scripting. It might not look like a lot, but I think we did a pretty good job with the time we had
            considering we started completely from scratch. 
            <br />
            <br />
            The thing I am most proud of with this project is that I was able to implement Keyboard and Mouse controls as well as add controller support within the timeframe we were given and
            without sacrificing other functionality.
            There is an entirely separate UI element that appears when the player is using a controller to show which direction the hammer is pointing. You can download Float and try it for yourself 
            <a href="https://lazybriefcase.itch.io/float" style="text-decoration:underline;color:inherit;">here</a>.
