            This project took maybe a day or two total of research + work to complete (time spent working, not from project start to project finish). The core part of the project 
            is the pathfinding script and the actual pathfinding algorithm that I came up with after a bit of research on how the algorithm 
            is supposed to work. It is comprised of two functions, CalculatePath and TraversePath.
            <br />
            <br />
            When called, the CalculatePath function gets all the neighboring Nodes that are open/walkable and puts them in a list. Then, it calculates the g, h, and f cost of each 
            of these Nodes, sorts them in order of f cost from least to greatest, picks the one with the lowest f cost and sets it as the current Node and adds it to a list called 
            pathNodes. It then repeats this loop until it reaches the end Node. Once the end Node is reached, the TraversePath function walks a game object through each of the Nodes 
            in the pathNodes list until it reaches the end Node.
            <br />
            <br />
            While the pathfinding script and the algorithm was implemented by me, I used some code from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague">Sebastian Lague's</a> A* tutorial 
            series to help set up the grid system. However, instead of leaving the grid in 2D and only using the X and Z axis, I added functionality for the Y axis as well, allowing the 
            algorithm to work in 3D.
            <br />
