        <p>
            I made Doomba for my Advanced Game Engine Scripting final project. I really enjoyed working on this project and I may continue to work on it in the future. 
            I got the idea for the game from a video that I watched where two people taped a knife and a balloon on two Roombas and let them loose to see which would pop first.
            <br />
            <br />
            I did pretty much everything myself for this project. The only things I didn't personally make were the floor texture, music, and a couple of sound effects. 
            I made all the rest of the art assets in a program called pixelmator. I recorded me making a popping noise with my mouth and dropping a pen for the 
            balloon popping and trash pickup sound effects. I used Audacity to record, edit, and export the sounds.
            <br />
            <br />
            The coding side of things for this project were pretty simple. I used the AddForce and AddTorque functions to affect the Rigidbodies of the Roombas 
            to make them move and turn. I also used OnTrigger functions to detect when the knives hit the balloons to pop them. For the "trash", I instantiated 
            a prefab at a random location within the arena every time a timer that I had set up hits 0. Every time a piece of trash is spawned the timer is reset.
            <br />
            <br />
            I had some trouble with Unity's tags and sorting layers in this project. The knives were on a sorting layer above the other Roomba but below the 
            tape which looked weird. I also tried to make it so that the particles for the knife collision would happen at the exact point of collision, 
            however there were some difficulties and I ended up changing it to where both knives would emit particles anytime they collided.
            <br />
            <br />
            Overall, I am very proud of this project and enjoyed making it. I would like to continue to work on it and maybe tweak the mechanics, add 
            more levels, and possibly even make it into an app.
