        <p>
            This was my final project for my Game Production class and also my first time using Unreal Engine to build a game.
            I liked the original concept for the game, but I wasn't sure that it would be appropriate for a school setting. I
            ended up going with it anyway because I found it funny and I wanted to make it happen.
            <br />
            <br />
            The hardest part in this project was figuring out the Blueprints system. I had never used it before and it required
            a lot of googling for me to figure out some stuff. Once I got the hang of it, however, it became much easier to use.
            <br />
            <br />
            Overall I am pleased with the result, however it got a little 'messy' with some of the blueprints and if I wanted
            to take the project any further I think I would have to clean that up a bit. I might get around to it in the future. We'll see.
