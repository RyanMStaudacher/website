            Chauffer Charon is a project I helped to develop for Train Jam 2018. The idea is that you play as the Greek ferryman 
            Charon but modernized and you work as a taxi driver now to "ferry" other figures from Greek mythology across the city. 
            As Charon you have the ability to jump in your taxi and drive up the sides of buildings. I coded the vehicle movement 
            for this project. It turned out a little bit finnicky in the end and doesn't feel great, but I think I did a decent 
            job with the time we had and with the skill level I was at at that time. I remember for this project I got really super 
            focused on trying to make a good state machine for some reason. I was so focused on that, and it didn't end up working 
            in the end and we had to just get rid of a bunch of code that I made. It was a good lesson for me.
