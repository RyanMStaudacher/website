    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>What I currently do: I am a Quality Assurance Tester for Deep Silver Volition!</p>

    <p>What I would like to do: My goal is to become a Gameplay Programmer. 
    I enjoy scripting game mechanics and features and tweaking and polishing them until they shine.</p>

    <p>I have a BA in Game Design with a concentration in Game Development. 
    I have experience with multiple game engines and software, including Unity, 
    Unreal Engine 4, Git, Github, Bitbucket, Sourcetree, Visual Studio, Blender, 
    Trello, Jira, etc. I am proficient in C# with a basic knowledge of some other 
    languages such as C++, Java, HTML, and CSS. I have worked on various projects 
    with teams varying in size from 2 to 40+ and I have experience with both the 
    agile and waterfall development processes. I was a Gameplay Programmer and 
    level designer for Aiku, Columbia's capstone project for 2018, and a Gameplay 
    Programmer for Quickdraw, a local 4-player co-op Western arena battle game.</p>

    <p>When I'm not making games I enjoy doing various things such as going to 
    the gym, playing volleyball, and hanging out with my friends. I love traveling 
    and there are plenty of places that I would like to go visit: Austria, 
    Scotland, Japan, Europe, etc. I am also an avid gamer and you can often find 
    me relaxing at my computer, playing my favorite games.</p>
