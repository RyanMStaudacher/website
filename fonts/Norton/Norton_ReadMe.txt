Norton is a full character set based on the five letters in the famous Norton Motorcycles logo.

K-Type has attempted to remain true to the spirit of the original identity, whilst updating the face, particularly the upper case, to sit more comfortably in contemporary usage.

A reconditioned Norton logo appears at two keystrokes, plusminus ± and section §.

Thanks to Paul Lloyd for the influence of his font, Duvall, and to Johan François for suggesting the project.
