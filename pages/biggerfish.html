        <p>
            The Bigger Fish mod is a mod that I created for the game Subnautica and Subnautica Below Zero. The mod gives the player nearly full control of 
            certain creature values, such as size, health, 'slowness'(a setting that makes creatures rotate and animate slower), etc. The player can tweak these 
            values for every single creature in the game. There are also now settings that lets the player randomize the sizes of the creatures.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I used the <a href="https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html">BepInEx modding framework</a> 
            to inject my custom code along with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1262">Nautilus library</a> in order 
            to achieve the functionality I wanted. By far the most difficult part of the project was figuring out how to properly use the 'ModOptions' from the 
            Nautilus library in order to get the Menu UI to work the way I envisioned. I did manage to figure it out using the API documentation and got it working 
            the way I wanted. Overall, I am very proud of this project and happy with the way it turned out! And other people also seem to be enjoying it from the comments 
            I have read.
